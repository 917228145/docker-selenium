Placeholder to allow forks to build this image.

This meta file is in JSON format and should reference the SCM source location the Docker image was built from.

The JSON file should contain a single JSON dictionary with the following keys:

url
The SCM URL in the format <SCM-PROVIDER>:<PROVIDER-SPECIFIC-REPO-LOCATION>.

revision
The SCM revision, e.g. the full git commit sha1. The revision should end with the marker text 
” (locally modified)” for unclean working directories.
This marker text ensures that no exact match for such revisions can be found in the remote SCM repository.

author
Name of the file’s author. The author is responsible for the correctness of the file’s contents.

status
Optional SCM working directory status information.
Might contain git status output for example.

Example file:

{
    "url": "git:git@github.com:elgalu/docker-selenium.git",
    "revision": "4af973351e7d418b67e3eba9de3dc889a71000ea",
    "author": "elgalu",
    "status": ""
}
